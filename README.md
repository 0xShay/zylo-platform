## Preview

There is a live demo version deployed at https://zylo.netlify.app/, so before building the project, if you just want to view the end result check out that site.

## Deploy

To spin up a locally-running instance of the platform, first clone the repository to a folder. If you have git installed, you can use
```
git clone https://github.com/0xShay/zylo-platform
```

Enter the project directory in a terminal window, and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```

This will launch the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
